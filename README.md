# Weather Grid

A little project to make some vibey colours out of a weather API. It shows 3 columns by default (to represent the next three days) with 24 rows each (to represent the hours in the day) which change colour depending on the weather.

### Getting started

Clone and move into the root of this file from the CL

```bash
yarn 
echo REACT_APP_WEATHER_KEY={APIKEY} > .env
yarn start 
```

### Issues

Changing the amount of days represented doesn't work :(
